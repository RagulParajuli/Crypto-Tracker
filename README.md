### Here's a breakdown of your Jetpack Compose Android Crypto Tracker project in bullet points:
## App Initialization & Architecture:
    -The app is built in Kotlin, using Jetpack Compose for declarative UI.
    -Follows MVVM or Clean Architecture: uses ViewModel, Repository, UseCase layers, plus DI through Hilt or Koin 
    -Communicates with the CoinGecko API (or similar), retrieving live price and market data via Ktor / Retrofit, using Kotlinx Serialization for JSON parsing 

## Home Screen (Crypto List):
    -Displays a scrollable list of top cryptocurrencies using LazyColumn.
    -Each list item shows coin logo, name, symbol, current price, and 24‑hour percentage change (color‑coded).
    -Tapping a coin navigates to the Detail Screen for that coin 

## Search & Favorites:
    -Provides a SearchBar or TextField to filter the list by coin name or symbol in real time.
    -Allows users to mark favorites, e.g. via a heart icon; favorites appear at top or in a separate list 

## Coin Detail Screen:
    -Shows detailed metrics: 24h/7d change %, circulating supply, market cap, daily highs/lows.
    -Renders a historical price chart (e.g. 7‑day) using a custom Canvas‑based line chart or built‑in chart library 
    -Includes light/dark mode theming with Material 3 components for consistent UX 

## Navigation:
    -Uses Compose Navigation for moving between screens.
    -Likely implements nested navigation graphs: separate flow for authentication (if present) and main app, managed with NavHost and NavController 

## Settings & Preferences:
    *Offers settings such as:
      -Selecting preferred currency (USD, EUR, etc.)
      -Chart historical range (e.g. 1–14 days)
      -Cache duration for API data refresh (e.g. 5 minutes)
      -Option to reset favorites and settings to default 

## Technical Details & Utilities:
    -Uses Coroutines + Flow / StateFlow for asynchronous data handling and UI state updates 
    -Dependency Injection via Hilt or Koin to manage repositories, network client, etc. 
    -Loads coin images via Coil or Landscapist with Glide/Fresco support 
    -Optional integrations: Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting.
